This is the source code and build environment for the UnboundID LDAP SDK for
Java, a fast, comprehensive, and easy-to-use Java API for communicating with
LDAP directory servers and performing related tasks like reading and writing
LDIF, encoding and decoding data using Base64 and ASN.1 BER, and performing
secure communication.

The LDAP SDK is open source under the terms of the GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1 licenses.
It is also available under the non-open source UnboundID LDAP SDK Free Use
License, which allows the LDAP SDK to be freely used in free or commercial
applications as long as the LDAP SDK itself is not altered.  See the
LICENSE-GPLv2.txt, LICENSE-LGPLv2.1.txt, and LICENSE-UnboundID-LDAPSDK.txt
files for the specific details of each license.

The easiest way to build the LDAP SDK is to simply run the build.sh shell
script (or the build.bat batch file on Windows systems) without any arguments,
or to invoke Apache Ant directly and target the build.xml build file.  The
resulting build files may be found in the build/package directory.
