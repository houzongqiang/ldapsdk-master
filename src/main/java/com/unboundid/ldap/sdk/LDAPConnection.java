/**
 * This class provides a facility for interacting with an LDAPv3 directory
 * server.  It provides a means of establishing a connection to the server,
 * sending requests, and reading responses.  See
 * <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt">RFC 4511</A> for the LDAPv3
 * protocol specification and more information about the types of operations
 * defined in LDAP.
 * <BR><BR>
 * <H2>Creating, Establishing, and Authenticating Connections</H2>
 * An LDAP connection can be established either at the time that the object is
 * created or as a separate step.  Similarly, authentication can be performed on
 * the connection at the time it is created, at the time it is established, or
 * as a separate process.  For example:
 * <BR><BR>
 * <PRE>
 *   // Create a new, unestablished connection.  Then connect and perform a
 *   // simple bind as separate operations.
 *   LDAPConnection c = new LDAPConnection();
 *   c.connect(address, port);
 *   BindResult bindResult = c.bind(bindDN, password);
 *
 *   // Create a new connection that is established at creation time, and then
 *   // authenticate separately using simple authentication.
 *   LDAPConnection c = new LDAPConnection(address, port);
 *   BindResult bindResult = c.bind(bindDN, password);
 *
 *   // Create a new connection that is established and bound using simple
 *   // authentication all in one step.
 *   LDAPConnection c = new LDAPConnection(address, port, bindDN, password);
 * </PRE>
 * <BR><BR>
 * When authentication is performed at the time that the connection is
 * established, it is only possible to perform a simple bind and it is not
 * possible to include controls in the bind request, nor is it possible to
 * receive response controls if the bind was successful.  Therefore, it is
 * recommended that authentication be performed as a separate step if the server
 * may return response controls even in the event of a successful authentication
 * (e.g., a control that may indicate that the user's password will soon
 * expire).  See the {@link BindRequest} class for more information about
 * authentication in the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.
 * <BR><BR>
 * By default, connections will use standard unencrypted network sockets.
 * However, it may be desirable to create connections that use SSL/TLS to
 * encrypt communication.  This can be done by specifying a
 * {@link SocketFactory} that should be used to create the socket to
 * use to communicate with the directory server.  The
 * {@link SSLSocketFactory#getDefault} method or the
 * {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLContext#getSocketFactory} method may be used to
 * obtain a socket factory for performing SSL communication.  See the
 * <A HREF=
 * "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html">
 * JSSE Reference Guide</A> for more information on using these classes.
 * Alternately, you may use the {@link com.unboundid.util.ssl.SSLUtil} class to
 * simplify the process.
 * <BR><BR>
 * Whenever the connection is no longer needed, it may be terminated using the
 * {@link LDAPConnection#close} method.
 * <BR><BR>
 * <H2>Processing LDAP Operations</H2>
 * This class provides a number of methods for processing the different types of
 * operations.  The types of operations that can be processed include:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>Abandon -- This may be used to request that the server stop processing
 *      on an operation that has been invoked asynchronously.</LI>
 *   <LI>Add -- This may be used to add a new entry to the directory
 *       server.  See the {@link AddRequest} class for more information about
 *       processing add operations.</LI>
 *   <LI>Bind -- This may be used to authenticate to the directory server.  See
 *       the {@link BindRequest} class for more information about processing
 *       bind operations.</LI>
 *   <LI>Compare -- This may be used to determine whether a specified entry has
 *       a given attribute value.  See the {@link CompareRequest} class for more
 *       information about processing compare operations.</LI>
 *   <LI>Delete -- This may be used to remove an entry from the directory
 *       server.  See the {@link DeleteRequest} class for more information about
 *       processing delete operations.</LI>
 *   <LI>Extended -- This may be used to process an operation which is not
 *       part of the core LDAP protocol but is a custom extension supported by
 *       the directory server.  See the {@link ExtendedRequest} class for more
 *       information about processing extended operations.</LI>
 *   <LI>Modify -- This may be used to alter an entry in the directory
 *       server.  See the {@link ModifyRequest} class for more information about
 *       processing modify operations.</LI>
 *   <LI>Modify DN -- This may be used to rename an entry or subtree and/or move
 *       that entry or subtree below a new parent in the directory server.  See
 *       the {@link ModifyDNRequest} class for more information about processing
 *       modify DN operations.</LI>
 *   <LI>Search -- This may be used to retrieve a set of entries in the server
 *       that match a given set of criteria.  See the {@link SearchRequest}
 *       class for more information about processing search operations.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * <BR><BR>
 * Most of the methods in this class used to process operations operate in a
 * synchronous manner.  In these cases, the SDK will send a request to the
 * server and wait for a response to arrive before returning to the caller.  In
 * these cases, the value returned will include the contents of that response,
 * including the result code, diagnostic message, matched DN, referral URLs, and
 * any controls that may have been included.  However, it also possible to
 * process operations asynchronously, in which case the SDK will return control
 * back to the caller after the request has been sent to the server but before
 * the response has been received.  In this case, the SDK will return an
 * {@link AsyncRequestID} object which may be used to later abandon or cancel
 * that operation if necessary, and will notify the client when the response
 * arrives via a listener interface.
 * <BR><BR>
 * This class is mostly threadsafe.  It is possible to process multiple
 * concurrent operations over the same connection as long as the methods being
 * invoked will not change the state of the connection in a way that might
 * impact other operations in progress in unexpected ways.  In particular, the
 * following should not be attempted while any other operations may be in
 * progress on this connection:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>
 *     Using one of the {@code connect} methods to re-establish the connection.
 *   </LI>
 *   <LI>
 *     Using one of the {@code close} methods to terminate the connection.
 *   </LI>
 *   <LI>
 *     Using one of the {@code bind} methods to attempt to authenticate the
 *     connection (unless you are certain that the bind will not impact the
 *     identity of the associated connection, for example by including the
 *     retain identity request control in the bind request if using the
 *     LDAP SDK in conjunction with a Ping Identity, UnboundID, or
 *     Alcatel-Lucent 8661 Directory Server).
 *   </LI>
 *   <LI>
 *     Attempting to make a change to the way that the underlying communication
 *     is processed (e.g., by using the StartTLS extended operation to convert
 *     an insecure connection into a secure one).
 *   </LI>
 * </UL>
