/**
 * This package contains a set of classes that may be used to ease the process
 * of migrating an application originally written to use the Java Naming and
 * Directory Interface (JNDI) so that it uses the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java
 * instead (or at the very least, to make it possible to use some of the
 * advanced functionality of the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java in an application
 * which is based on JNDI).  Classes in this package are primarily designed to
 * convert between JNDI data structures and their equivalents in the UnboundID
 * LDAP SDK for Java.
