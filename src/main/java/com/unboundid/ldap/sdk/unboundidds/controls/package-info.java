/**
 * This package contains implementations for a number of LDAP controls which are
 * specific to the Ping Identity, UnboundID, and Alcatel-Lucent 8661 Directory
 * Server products.  In some cases, they may be based on standard controls which
 * have not yet reached a sufficient stability level to make them available for
 * general use against any kind of server, while in other cases they may be
 * defined specifically for use with the Ping Identity, UnboundID, and
 * Alcatel-Lucent 8661 Directory Server.

 *   <B>NOTE:</B>  The classes within this package, and elsewhere within the
 *   {@code com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.unboundidds} package structure, are only
 *   supported for use against Ping Identity, UnboundID, and Alcatel-Lucent 8661
 *   server products.  These classes provide support for proprietary
 *   functionality or for external specifications that are not considered stable
 *   or mature enough to be guaranteed to work in an interoperable way with
 *   other types of LDAP servers.
